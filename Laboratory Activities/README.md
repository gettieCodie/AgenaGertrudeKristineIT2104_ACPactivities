### 🛍️ **Item 2: Discount Calculation**

This activity allows the user to input the total purchase amount and calculates the applicable discount based on the purchase value. If the purchase exceeds `5000`, the user will receive a `10%` discount; otherwise, a `5%` discount is applied. The user can continue to enter new amounts or exit the loop when they’re done.

#### 🎯 **Goal:**
- 💡 **To understand the application of conditional logic in calculating discounts.**
- 🧮 **To practice handling user input and performing mathematical operations.**
- 🔄 **To demonstrate the use of loops and repetition in user-driven processes.**

#### 📝 **Instructions:**
- Enter the total purchase amount (e.g., `5000`).
- The program will calculate and display the discount based on the amount.
- You can continue entering new amounts or exit by answering "no" when asked if you want to try again.
