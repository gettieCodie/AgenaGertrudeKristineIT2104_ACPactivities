### 🛍️ **Item 2: Discount Calculation**

This activity allows the user to input the total purchase amount and calculates the applicable discount based on the purchase value. If the purchase exceeds `5000`, the user will receive a `10%` discount; otherwise, a `5%` discount is applied. The user can continue to enter new amounts or exit the loop when they’re done.

#### 🎯 **Goal:**
- 💡 **To understand the application of conditional logic in calculating discounts.**
- 🧮 **To practice handling user input and performing mathematical operations.**
- 🔄 **To demonstrate the use of loops and repetition in user-driven processes.**

#### 📝 **Instructions:**
- Enter the total purchase amount (e.g., `5000`).
- The program will calculate and display the discount based on the amount.
- You can continue entering new amounts or exit by answering "no" when asked if you want to try again.

For more details, see the [Activity](https://github.com/gettieCodie/AgenaGertrudeKristineIT2104_ACPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%202%20-%20%2025-September-2024/lab2_item2.py).

## 🌟 **Laboratory Activity 3: Functions and Dictionaries** 🔢

### 🔢 **Item 1: Roman Numeral to Integer Converter**
This activity allows the user to input a Roman numeral, and the program will convert it to its corresponding integer value.

#### 🎯 **Goal:**
- 🔠 **To practice string manipulation and dictionary lookups.**
- 🧮 **To convert Roman numerals to their integer equivalents.**
- 💡 **To understand conditional logic for Roman numeral subtraction (e.g., `IV` for 4).**

#### 📝 **Instructions:**

### 🐾 **Item 2: Array Element Access with Error Handling**
This activity demonstrates the use of arrays (lists in Python) and how to handle potential errors when accessing array elements using an index. The program prompts the user to input an array of floating-point numbers and then allows the user to access and print an element from the array, while also handling `IndexError` exceptions gracefully.

#### 🎯 **Goal:**
